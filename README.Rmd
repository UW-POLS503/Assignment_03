## Instructions

1. [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to your GitHub account.
2. Write your solutions in R Markdown in a file named `solutions.Rmd`.
3. When you are ready to submit your assignment, [initiate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#initiating-the-pull-request). Title your
pull request "Submission".

To update your fork from the upstream repository:

1. On your fork, e.g. `https://github.com/jrnold/Assignment_03` click on "New Pull reqest"
2. Set your fork `jrnold/Assignment_03` as the base fork on the left, and `UW-POLS503/Assignment_03` as the head fork on the right. In both cases the branch will be master. This means, compare any chanes in the head fork that are not in the base fork. You will see differences between the `US-POLS503` repo and your fork. Click on "Create Pull Request", and if there are no issues, "Click Merge" A quick way is to use this link, but change the `jrnold` to your own username: `https://github.com/jrnold/Assignment_03/compare/master...UW-POLS503:master`.

We'll use these packages,
```{r message=FALSE}
library("foreign")
library("dplyr")
library("broom")
library("ggplot2")
library("DT")
```
Since we are going to do some simulation, we shoudl set a seed, so the results are exactly replicable.
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
```
Since some of these computations will take time, we can cache the results so that knitr will
only run code that has changed.
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, autodep = TRUE)
```

## Nunn and Wantchekon AER 2011 example

Let's run some regressions from 

> Nunn, Nathan and Leonard Wantchekon. 2011. "The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa."	American Economic Review,
> 101(7):3221-52. [doi:10.1257/aer.101.7.3221](https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.7.3221)

The replication data for the is available from its [AER site](https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.7.3221), but the main
dataset is included in this repository.
Since the main dataset is a Stata `.dta` file load it using the `read.dta` function
and convert it to a **dplyr** `tbl` so the `print` function produces nicer output.
```{r}
nunn <- read.dta("Nunn_Wantchekon_AER_2011.dta") %>% tbl_df()
```

There are many variables in this data.
When `read.dta` converts a Stata data file the descriptions of the variables end up
in an R [attribute](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/attributes.html) `"var.labels"`.
Print out the variable lables to get the descriptions of the files[^datatable]
```{r variable-labels,results = 'asis',cache=FALSE}
data_frame(variable = names(nunn), description = attr(nunn, "var.labels")) %>%
  datatable(class = 'cell-border stripe')
```


[^datatable]: This uses the [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package to produce pretty interactive tables in the HTML.

In Table 1, NW run several models with Trust in Neighbors as an outcome variable,
different measures of slave exports as the treatment variable, and the same set of controls variables.
The relevant variables in the data are:

- `trust_neighbors`: Trust of neighbors
- `exports`: Slave exports in 1000s
- Individual controls: `age`, `age2`, `male`, `urban_dum`, `education`, `occupation`, `religion`, `living_conditions`
- District controls: `district_ethnic_frac`, `frac_ethnicity_in_district`
- Country-fixed effects: `isocode`



### Bivariate regression

Run a regression of the Trust of Neighbors on Slave exports.
This is Table 1, Model 1, witout any of the control variables.
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(trust_neighbors ~ exports, data = nunn)
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- Interpret the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficient on `trust_neighbors`.
- Plot the fitted values and confidence interval of the fitted values of regression vs. `exports`.
- Plot the residuals of this regresion against the fitted values of the regression. Do they appear to have
  constant variance? Are they approximately symmetric?
- What is the null hypothesis of the t-test reported by `summary()`? Explain the meaning of the p-value.
  Be precise. Is the p-value the probability that the null hypothesis is correct?
</div>

Frequentist statistics assigns no probabilities to hypotheses (parameter values).
They are either true or false, but they are unknown. Only samples are random variables, and have an associated probability.
But as scientists, we are generally interested in the probability that a hypothesis is correct.[^nature]
The probability that the research hypothesis ($H_0$) is correct can be calculated with Bayes law,
$$
p(H_0 | \text{data}) = \frac{p(\text{data | H_0} p(H_0))}{p(\text{data} | H_a) p(H_a) + p(\text{data} | H_0) p(H_0)} = \frac{p(\text{data | H_a} p(H_a))}{p(\text{data})} .
$$
Working somewhat informally, the p-value gives $p(\text{data} | H_0)$. An important missing piece of information is the baseline or prior probabilty that the null hypothesis is true, $p(H_0)$, which is the complement of the probability that the research hypothesis is true, $p(H_0) = 1 - p(H_a)$,[^h0] [^jeff]

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- If more than the p-value is required to make sense of the research findings, what does the article do to increase your belief
  about $p(H_a)$?
- Suppose you believed that NW were p-value hacking (which I don't think they are!). What part of Bayes law is that 
  affecting? If you think that someone is p-value hacking, then you are saying that they will always produce significant p-values regardless of whether the null or alternative hypotheses are true.
</div>

[^nature]: See the discussion in (Scientific method: Statistical errors)[http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700], *Nature*.

[^jeff]: This question is non-standard and idiosyncratic to the way I interpret research.

[^h0]: Assuming, for simplicity, that $H_0$ and $H_a$ are the only hypotheses so that $p(H_0) + p(H_a) = 1$.

In the models in Table 1, NW includes control variables to account for individual, district, and country-level 
variables that may explain differences.

### Multiple regression

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- What are the control variables that NW include in the models in Table 1?
- Run the model in Table 1, Regression 1 and report the results: coefficients, p-values, etc.
- Interpret the coefficient on `exports`
- How much does the coefficient change with the addition of control variables? What does that suggest?
- Do the R^2 and number of observations match those reported in Table 1?
- Calculate the fitted values of the regression by multiplying the $\beta$ vector and the $\mat{X}$ matrix.
  Confirm that you get the same results as using `predict()`.
</div>

In this regression

Run the regresssion 

### Validity of the standard errors

One of the assumptions necessary for OLS standard errors to be correct is homoskedasticity homoskedasticity (constant variance), and that the errors are uncorrelated.

<div class="bs-collout"
- How might that assumption be violated?
- Plot the residuals of the regression by district. Do they appear to be uncorrelated? What does that say about the validity of the OLS standard errors?
- Do the standard errors match those in Table 1? What sort of standard errors does the article use?
</div>

### log slave exports per capita

<div>
- Run the regression in Table 1, model 6, which uses "log(1 + exports / pop)" as a measure of slave exports.
- Interpret the effect of this variable
- Why is "log(1 + exports / pop)" used as the measure instead of "log(exports / pop)"?
- Plot the fitted values of log(1 + exports / pop) and their confidence interval against "log(1 + exports / pop)" against the residuals of the controls only regression. Include the line, confidence intervals, and data points.
- Plot the fitted values of exports / pop against the residuals of the controls only regression. Include the line, confidence intervals, and data points. How does this relationship differ from the one which used the level of slave exports with out taking the logarithm or adjusting for population?
</div>

### Sampling distribution of coefficients

Let's understand what the confidence intervals mean in terms of the sampling distribution.
Since we don't know the true parameter values for this, we will pretend that the OLS point estimates are
the "true" population parameters.

Given an OLS model with estimated $\hat{\beta}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$, and data, the function
does `resampler_coef`,

1. Sample $y^* \sim N(\hat{\beta} X, \hat{\sigma}^2)$
2. Estimate OLS estimates $\tilde{y} = \beta^* X + $\varepsilon^*$
3. Repeat steps 1--2, `iter` times, store $\beta^*$ for each iteration, and
   return the estimates for all samples.
   
The distribution of the $\beta^*$ is a sampling distribution of the parameters.
```{r}
resampler_coef <- function(mod, .data, iter = 1) {
  # Remove missing values
  .data <- na.omit(.data)
  # Coefficients
  beta <- coef(mod)
  # mod$terms contains the formula used in the regression
  X <- model.matrix(mod$terms, data = .data)
  # estimate of std. dev. of errors
  sigma <- sqrt(sum(mod$residuals ^ 2) / mod$df.residual)
  # This produces the same result
  # sigma <- summary(mod1)$sigma  
  # Number of observations
  n <- nrow(X)
  # Name of dependent variable
  outcome_var_name <- all.vars(mod$terms)[1]
  # List to save results
  results <- vector(mode = "list", length = iter)
  for (i in seq_len(iter)) {
    # draw errors
    errors <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
    # create new outcome variable from errors
    y <- X %*% beta + errors
    # replace outcome variable
    .data[[outcome_var_name]] <- y
    # run regression
    newmod <- lm(mod$terms, data = .data)
    # Save coefficients as a data frame to the list
    results[[i]] <- tidy(newmod) %>% mutate(.iter = i)
  }
  # Convert the list of data frames to a single data frame by stacking the iterations
  bind_rows(results)
}
```

Suppose that `mod_1_6` is the model containing the results of the model in Table 1, Model 6.
Simulate the sampling distribution of the 
```{r eval=FALSE}
beta_dist <- resampler_coef(mod_1_6, nunn, iter = 1024)
head(beta_dist)
```

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- Plot the distributions of the coefficients of 
- Calculate the correlation matrix of the coefficients.
  How similar is it to that returned from `vcov(mod)
</div>

### Bootstrapping

What you just did is an example of parametric bootstrap.
It is a parametric bootstrap because you drew data from an assumed model (the OLS model that you estimated).

An alternative is a non-parametric bootstrap.
In a non-parametric bootstrap, instead of drawing samples from model, we are going to redraw samples from the sample.

![Head Exploding Gif](head-exploding-gif-tim-and-eric.gif)

An analogy is that the sample is to the population as the bootstrap is to the sample.
We are treating the sample distribution as an estimate of the populution distribution and then drawing samples from
that estimated population distribution.

To do the bootstrapping we will use the `bootstrap` function in the **tidyr** package.
However, the [boot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html) package supports many more advanced methods of bootstrapping.

Let's start by drawing a single bootstrap replication.
It is a sample of the same size as the original data, drawn from the data *with replacement*.
```{r message=FALSE,results='hide'}
nunn_bootstrapped <- bootstrap(nunn, 1)
```

So, in order to calculate boostrapped standard erorrs, we will need to draw a sample of 
To get bootstrap standard errors, we draw `B` replications, run an  regression, and save the estimates. 
```{r message=FALSE, results='hide'}
beta_bs <- 
  bootstrap(nunn, 1024) %>%
    do(tidy(lm(trust_neighbors ~ exports, data = nunn)))
```

There are several ways to calculate standard errors from bootstraped replications.
The following are two simple methods.

1. Calculate the standard error from these simulations by taking the standard deviation of the estimates.
   Suppose $\beta^{*b}_k$ is the estimated cofficient from replication $b \in 1:B$, and $\bar\tilde^{*}_k = (\sum \beta^{*b}_k) / B$.
   Then the bootstrap standard error is,
   $$
   \se_k(\hat\beta_{k}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B - 1} \sum (\beta^{*b}_k - \bar\beta^{*b}_k)^2}
   $$
   The confidence interval is thus,
   $$
   \hat{\beta}_k \pm \se_{bs}(\hat\beta_k)
   $$
   Note that you use the estimate $\hat{\beta}_k$ from the original model, not the mean of the bootstrap estimates.
   This method works well if the sampling distribution of $\beta_k$ is symmetric.

2. The second method is to use the quantiles of the bootstap estimates.
   E.g. a 95% confidence interval uses the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the boostrap estimates.
   This method allows for asymmetric confidence intervals. However, it takes more replications to get accurate 
   values of extreme quantiles than it does to calculate a standard deviation.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- Estimate the bootstrapped confidence intervals using those two methods.
- Compare the bootstrapped confidence intervals to the OLS confidence interval.
</div>

There are even more advanced methods such as the studentized bootstrap, and the adjusted boostrap percentile (BCa) methods
included in `boot.ci`.

For bootstrapped standard errors to be valid, the samples from the data need to be taken in the same way as the sample
was taken from the population. 
For example, in a time series it would be inappropriate to sample observations without accounting for their order.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
- What is the population in this paper?
- How was the sample drawn from this population?
- In the previous examples, did we draw the sample in the same way as it was drawn from the population? What would
  be a better way of drawing the bootstrapped samples? Try to implement it, and compare the differences.
</div>

### F-test example

An $F$-test tests the null hypthosis that several coefficients in the regression are all 0 vs. the alternative that 
at least one of the coefficients is non-zero.

$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
H_0: &\quad \beta_j = \dots = \beta_J = 0
H_a: &\quad \text{at least one $\beta_k \neq 0$}
\end{aligned}
$$


- Run F-tests of the multiple regression model vs. the model with no controls.
- Run and interpet an F-test on some reasonable group of variables.

F-test simulations

```{r}
resampler_models <- function(mod, .data, iter = 1) {
  # Remove missing values
  .data <- na.omit(.data)
  # Coefficients
  beta <- coef(mod)
  # mod$terms contains the formula used in the regression
  X <- model.matrix(mod$terms, data = .data)
  # estimate of std. dev. of errors
  sigma <- sqrt(sum(mod$residuals ^ 2) / mod$df.residual)
  # This produces the same result
  # sigma <- summary(mod1)$sigma  
  # Number of observations
  n <- nrow(X)
  # Name of dependent variable
  outcome_var_name <- all.vars(mod$terms)[1]
  # List to save results
  results <- vector(mode = "list", length = iter)
  for (i in seq_len(iter)) {
    # draw errors
    errors <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
    # create new outcome variable from errors
    y <- X %*% beta + errors
    # replace outcome variable
    .data[[outcome_var_name]] <- y
    # run regression
    newmod <- lm(mod$terms, data = .data)
    # Save model stats as a data frame to the list
    results[[i]] <- glimpse(newmod) %>% mutate(.iter = i)
  }
  # Convert the list of data frames to a single data frame by stacking the iterations
  bind_rows(results)
}
```

## Multiple comparisons and F-test

```{r results='hide'}
noise <- data.frame(matrix(rnorm(2100), nrow = 100, ncol = 21))
summary(lm(noise))
```

- How many variables have t-tests that are significant?
- Is the F-test significant? 
- Explain the difference
