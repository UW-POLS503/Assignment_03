<p>To update your fork from the upstream repository:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On your fork, e.g. <code>https://github.com/jrnold/Assignment_03</code> click on “New Pull reqest”</li>
<li>Set your fork <code>jrnold/Assignment_03</code> as the base fork on the left, and <code>UW-POLS503/Assignment_03</code> as the head fork on the right. In both cases the branch will be master. This means, compare any chanes in the head fork that are not in the base fork. You will see differences between the <code>US-POLS503</code> repo and your fork. Click on “Create Pull Request”, and if there are no issues, “Click Merge” A quick way is to use this link, but change the <code>jrnold</code> to your own username: <code>https://github.com/jrnold/Assignment_03/compare/master...UW-POLS503:master</code>.</li>

<p>The replication data for the is available from its <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.101.7.3221">AER site</a>, but the main dataset is included in this repository. Since the main dataset is a Stata <code>.dta</code> file load it using the <code>read.dta</code> function and convert it to a <strong>dplyr</strong> <code>tbl</code> so the <code>print</code> function produces nicer output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nunn &lt;- read.dta(&quot;Nunn_Wantchekon_AER_2011.dta&quot;) %&gt;% tbl_df()</code></pre>
<p>There are many variables in this data.

<p>In Table 1, NW run several models with Trust in Neighbors as an outcome variable, different measures of slave exports as the treatment variable, and the same set of controls variables. The relevant variables in the data are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust_neighbors</code>: Trust of neighbors</li>
<li><code>exports</code>: Slave exports in 1000s</li>
<li>Individual controls: <code>age</code>, <code>age2</code>, <code>male</code>, <code>urban_dum</code>, <code>education</code>, <code>occupation</code>, <code>religion</code>, <code>living_conditions</code></li>
<li>District controls: <code>district_ethnic_frac</code>, <code>frac_ethnicity_in_district</code></li>
<li>Country-fixed effects: <code>isocode</code></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Run a regression of the Trust of Neighbors on Slave exports. This is Table 1, Model 1, witout any of the control variables.</p>

</div>
<p>Frequentist statistics assigns no probabilities to hypotheses (parameter values). They are either true or false, but they are unknown. Only samples are random variables, and have an associated probability. But as scientists, we are generally interested in the probability that a hypothesis is correct.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This can be calculated using Bayes law as, <span class="math display">\[
p(H_0 | \text{data}) = \frac{p(\text{data | H_0} p(H_0))}{p(\text{data})}
\]</span> The p-value gives, teh The important missing piece of information is <span class="math inline">\(p(! H_0)\)</span>, the probability that the null hypothesis is not correct, i.e. the probability that the null hypothesis is correct, which is the probability that the research hypothesis is incorrect.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the standard error from these simulations by taking the standard deviation of the estimates.</li>
<li>Calculate the confidence interval using the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles in the replications</li>
